# Lucid.bid

Lucid.bid is a full revive and improvement of the script Lucid.lua, which lasted from early 2025 to late 2025.

Lucid.bid and Lucid.lua are related but are not the same script and do not use the same code
Lucid.lua was coded by Spheruz and lucid.bid is coded by Miwowa. **Lucid.bid does not and will not reuse code from lucid.lua.**
The lucid.lua name was fully given with permission from **CSphere and Spheruz**.

Lucid.bid will have everything that made lucid so popular,
**Transparency**
**No premiums, nobody has admin commands to kick you, not even the developers.**
**Honesty**
**Free**
**Ease of use**
**Frequent updates**
**Community listening**

weird writing again because i just copied this from the discord lol
