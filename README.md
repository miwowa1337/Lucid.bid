# Lucid.bid

Lucid.bid (formerly lucid.lua) is a 2 year old da hood script originally created by Spheruz and CheatSphere
Eventually the script was phased out and stopped updating.
The scripts name was bought and most links to it, and now the script is under the control of Miwowa.
Lucid.bid does not reuse code from lucid.lua.
